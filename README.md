# Air_pollution_Analysis

This is a simple project done by 7 people on Air Pollution Indication.

Air Pollution Analysis is an Machine Learning approach to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) of the region.

Air Quality Index (AQI) is the system used to warn the public when air pollution is dangerous.

he AQI tracks ozone (smog) and particle pollution (tiny particles from ash, power plants and factories, vehicle exhaust, soil dust, pollen, and other pollution), as well as four other widespread air pollutants.

In more than 800 counties across the nation, air pollution levels are measured daily and ranked on a scale of 0 for perfect air all the way up to 500 for air pollution levels that pose an immediate danger to the public
